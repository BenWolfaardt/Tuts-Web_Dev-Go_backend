# (Tuts) Web Development - Go backend

This repository contains various tutorials that I have worked through in order to increase my skills in the web development field, more specifically writting backends in `Go` such as to improve my knowledge for my current job as well as to learn how to create the backend for my personal website: [benwolfaardt.com](benwolfaardt.com) (comming soon!)

As not to ocupy too many repositories with "tutorials" I've decided to group them into a single repository by making use of the `git orphan` command - allowing you to have independent branches.

The branches, i.e. tutorials, that I have completed so far are as follows:
1. [go-writing_web_apps](https://github.com/BenWolfaardt/Tuts-Web_Dev-Go_backend/tree/go-writing_web_apps) - [source](https://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/)
2. [polygot-frontend_served_in_go](https://github.com/BenWolfaardt/Tuts-Web_Dev-Go_backend/tree/polygot-frontend_served_in_go) - [source](https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2017/03/bundle-html-css-javascript-served-golang-application/)

Naming convention of branches: 
* Before the `-` is the tutorial's website name;
* After the `-` is the tutorial's name;

// TODO: add numbers to branch names with the "01" formatting for up to 99 projects
// TODO: explain the git orphan approach as well as refernce the source;  
// TODO: do more tutorials;  
// TODO: update individual tutorial's `README.md`;  
// TODO: Get a temporary template up and running for [benwolfaardt.com](benwolfaardt.com);
