# (Tuts) Web Development - Go backend

This repository contains various tutorials that I have worked through in order to increase my skills in the web development field, more specifically writting backends in `Go` such as to improve my knowledge for my current job as well as to learn how to create the backend for my personal website: [BenWolfaardt.com](http://www.benwolfaardt.com) (visit now!)

> As not to ocupy too many repositories with "tutorials" I've decided to group them into a single repository by making use of the `git`'s `orphan` command - allowing you to have independent branches with their own independant `git` history. Further details can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/BenWolfaardt/50905fa3e10d73b3622a3148afffed09).
